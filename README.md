EnhancerAtlas 3.0 comprises a total of 57,264,271 annotated consensus enhancers derived from 38,504 datasets that encompass 24 species and 1,428 distinct tissues and cell types. The datasets incorporate information from 23 high-throughput sequencing technologies. Furthermore, we predicted enhancer-target interactions for human, mouse, and fly, with 1,642,747, 3,114,890, and 132,119 interactions identified, respectively.
